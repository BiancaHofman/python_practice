A cold breeze on the attic makes your hair stand on end.
The dusty rocking chair in the corner is moving back and forth.
Suddenly, a thin voice starts to whisper: "This is your granny...
Come here. Do you want to hear a story?"
Then, another voice starts to speak: "Don't listen to her!
That woman is not your grandmother...
Please, listen to me, I'm your grandfather."
Your grandparents? Ghosts? This is getting freaky! 
What do you do? 
Flee or listen?
