# python_practice

This script is part of exercise 35 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.


I changed the script exercise 35 and created my own script exercise 35b. 
To practise my skills, I changed the story line a bit, added and modified some functions and methods.
I'm still working on some improvements in this script.
