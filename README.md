# python_practice

This script is part of exercise 35 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.

Excercise 35 is a little adventure game, a story that develops based on the user's input.
I changed the script of exercise 35 and created my own script exercise 35b. 
To practise my skills, I changed the story line a bit, added and modified some functions and methods.
I'm still working on some improvements in this script.
