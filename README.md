# python_practice

ex35b is part of exercise 35 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.

Excercise 35 is a little adventure game, a story that develops based on the user's input.
I changed the script of exercise 35 and created my own script exercise 35b. 
To practise my skills, I changed the story line a bit, added and modified some functions and methods.
I'm still working on some improvements in this script.

Exercise 36 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way: I had to create from scratch a game like exercise 35 and try to add some methods and modules from earlier exercises.
  

This was my way of working:
1. Come up with a general story idea ---> using my paper notebook
2. Create a map to visualize the story flow and different functions ---> using https://www.draw.io/
3. Write the code and testing ---> using notebook ++ and powershell
4. Create a map to visualize detailed story content flow for different functions ---> https://www.draw.io/
5. Label all the different content pieces ---> using notebook ++
6. Create a csv sheet with overview of content pieces and their labels ---> using Google Sheets
7. Test ---> using powershell

Exercise 36 doesn't say you need to use mapping tools like https://www.draw.io/, label content pieces or create an overview in Google sheets. I did this, because I like to visualize and structure the information.
