# python_practice

ex35b is part of exercise 35 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.

Excercise 35 is a little adventure game, a story that develops based on the user's input.
I changed the script of exercise 35 and created my own script exercise 35b. 
To practise my skills, I changed the story line a bit, added and modified some functions and methods.
I'm still working on some improvements in this script.

ex36 is exercise 36 of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.
For exercise 36 I had to create from scratch a game like ex35b and try to add some methods and modules from earlier exercises.

These were the steps I followed:
1. general story idea ---> using my paper notebook
2. map to visualize the story flow and different functions ---> using dialog.io.
3. writing the code and testing ---> using notebook ++ and powershell
4. map to visualize more detailed story content flow for different functions ---> using dialog.oi
5. labeling the different content pieces ---> using notebook ++
6. csv sheet with overview of content pieces and their labels ---> using Google Sheets
7. testing ---> using powershell
